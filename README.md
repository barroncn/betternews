This app provides information about members of congress: recent votes, websites, and contact information. The most recent news articles from Politico news (obtained through NewsAPI) are also displayed. The goal is that people don't tune out politics because information is hard to find. Maybe you're frustrated with the way things are going. Maybe you're annoyed with how little your opinion seems to matter. Maybe you're happy with how everything is going. No matter how you feel, stay informed! Let your representatives know that you have a voice!

**Future Development**

If you visit the site you'll see the structure is there with some of the content and that user authentication is in place, but there's more to be done! When users log in there will be a page that displays local leader information based on the location information with which the user registered. Hopefully this will be up in the next couple days!
