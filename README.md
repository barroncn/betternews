This app provides information about the members of congress: recent votes, websites, and contact information. The most recent news articles from Politico news (obtained through NewsAPI) are also displayed. The goal is that people don't tune out politics because information is hard to find. Maybe your frustrated with the way things are going. Maybe your annoyed with how your opinion seems to matter. Maybe you *love* how everything is going. No matter how you feel, stay informed! Let your representatives know that you have a voice!

**Future Development**

If you visit the site you'll see that the structure and some of the content are there but there's more to be done. When users log in there will be a page that displays local leader information based on the location information with which the user registered. Hopefully this will be up in the next couple days!



**Technologies Used:**
